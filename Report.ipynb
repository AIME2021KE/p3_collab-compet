These are then detached from the resulting tensor to make a true copy, access Qtable for the next action, and hence the rewards of the target network. We then get the next action results from the local network and then determine the MSE loss between the target and local network fits. We then zero_grad the optimizer, propagate the loss backwards through the network, and perform a step in the optimizer. Finally a soft update is performed on the target network, using TAU times the local network parameters and (1-TAU) times the target network parameters to update the target network parameters.\n",

    "## APPROACH\n",
    "After many failed attempts with the MADDPG class, I reviewed the below solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/Nathan1123/P3_Collaboration_and_Competition\n",
    "https://github.com/ainvyu/p3-collab-compet\n",
    "\n",
    "which were quite simple but with large networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "From those reviews, I decided to simplify things (but leave the hooks in to show what I tried) and drop the MADDPG class. ALthough my approach is slightly different than either of these approaches, they were very helpful in focusing my next steps, especially just working with the DDPGAgents as a list of separate agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started with the default (intial) values for the previous DDPG except for the hidden layer sizes (used 20,20 (corporate mentor) and 400,300 (example cases), and then made changes to hyperparameters as I tested for sensitivity to those hyperparameters. I also tried later various suggestions from the corporate mentor, Udacity mentors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The the Tennis.ipynb you will see that I create two separate instances of the ddpg_agents and loop through them in the processing, looking for max of their scores\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest breakthrough aspect of our training was increasing the BUFFERSIZE from 16 to 128 (we also tried 64 and 256 buffer sizes  but 128 seemed to work best with our previously best \"searched for\" values). Although early on (with the MADDPG framework) increasing the buffersize didn't have much of any effect, with our simplier network implementation, all the larger sizes seemed to keep the learning going much longer, albiet in the other two cases the 100 sample moving average was more about 0.1 in about 4000-8000 episodes instead of the 0.5 we required\n",
    "\n",
    "We originally started with a higher gamma 0.9 and the previous values of the learning rates for the actor (1e-4) and critic (1e-3) but settled on the provided values in our final solution after our extensive earlier searches (but with the smaller buffersize). \n",
    "\n",
    "We searched on pretty much everything we could think of, including a number of approaches suggested by both mentors (increasing the hidden layer sizes, which was contrary to the corporate mentor suggestion to keep them small (20 and 20 was big enough)), ranging from 400,300 to 20,20. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly we examined 6 separate values of lra from 1e-3 to 1e-5 and 7 values of lrc from 2e-3 to 1e-5, although the search wasn't exhaustive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Values of gamma were explored from 0.8 to 0.99 and 5 values of tau from 1e-1 to 1e-3\n",
    "\n",
    "We also examined a number of suggestions from my corporate mentor (use parameter noise not action noise -- didn't seem to work at the time), and I looked briefly at adding state noise and dropout layers as well but eventually removed them as again they didn't seem to work and the prior examples I looked at didn't do that to get solutions, so I abandoned the effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another suggestion from my corporate mentor was to use a batchnorm1d after the first NN. I tried this as well but in the end I didn't see any improvement so I removed them as well, although I left in the hooks and commented code in case I want to generalize this capability in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I settled on the larger batch size (but with 20,20 hidden layer sizes), the results were promising but not sufficient so I started looking into increasing the hidden layer size and the 20,40 looked promising enough that I first set the episodes to exit after hitting the 0.5 mark, which it did shortly after 4000 iterations (8000 max) and then added a 10% buffer (0.55 before exit but print when it met the mark) and this took 7910 iterations (2.5 hrs to run!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although normally I would like to do a little more hyperparameter searches to try to optimize, I ran out of time and with a solution (>0.5) I submitted it as is.\n",

    "Like our previous project, we would have liked to potentially explore some of the post-DDPG example approaches, such as MADDPG (Multi-Agent DDPG) and the N-step. However since these were mainly modifications of the internal workings of the agents and the like, we felt that it was best to first get the baseline DDPG running and then see if there are problems about possibly making these modifications. \n",

    "So we start with our original agent and model, which we've imported locally and import the (slightly modified) DDPG function for the unity setup, and this was found to be sufficient for this exercise.\n",

    "As mentioned above we believe probably the greatest improvement will come from an N-step implementation, since this could provide information on longer-term solutions earlier and provide more information to the networks about longer term rewards.\n",
